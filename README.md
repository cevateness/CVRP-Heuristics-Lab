# CVRP_heuristics

An algorithm practice repository for multiple variants of Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP) problems. This repository uses instances from the CVRPLIB: [CVRPLIB](http://vrp.atd-lab.inf.puc-rio.br/index.php/en/)

## Overview

This repository is dedicated to exploring and developing various heuristics and algorithms for solving CVRP problems. The CVRP is a well-known NP-hard problem in combinatorial optimization, where the objective is to determine the optimal set of routes for a fleet of vehicles to deliver goods to a given set of customers, subject to vehicle capacity constraints.
